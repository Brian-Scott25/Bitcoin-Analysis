## Project Purpose

The focus of this project is to aid in investment strategies for Cryptocurrency traders. We intend to use statistical procedures to determine potential future prices, stop loss levels, and optimal points of entry.  

## OLS Prediction Model For BTC
The goal of this model is to determine BTC's closing price one week in the future, along with the directional change in price for BTC. I have added the R Markdown to the repository, and posted below is the link to the my RPubs account for this specific file. Although a logit or pobit model would be better suited for the direction question, I analyzed both directional change and point estimate accuracy in this script. I intend to post a logit model markdown soon.
